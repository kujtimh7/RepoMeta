# RepoMeta
# Git
I commited all changes to my HiWorld.java file and all the results are shown in git.txt and showed it through the commits.

# SVN
I did the same thing as in the Git test but forgot to show the files change, it still recognizes it however and the changes can be seen in my SVNTESTING repository. You can see SVN is simpler to use due to it not needing to use something like the git init command and allows for easier access to the repository.
